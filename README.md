# Accessibility review&mdash;longitudinal tracking

This repo is used by the [Accessible Platform Architectures WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/apawg/) to monitor the accessibility of specifications over time. We use the issues threads in this repository to tie together the results from _all_ reviews for a spec, throughout its lifetime.

Spec review project: https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/155/views/1

This is in contrast to the [a11y-request](https://github.com/w3c/a11y-request) and [a11y-tracking](https://github.com/w3c/a11y-tracking) repos, which are used to request reviews at specific times, and to track the results of those reviews.

Historical longitudinal spec review can be found in the APA wiki: https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Category:Spec_Review
